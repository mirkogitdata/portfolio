<h1>Portfolio description</h1>
You can see my portfolio <a href="https://mirkogitdata.github.io"  target="_blank">https://mirkogitdata.github.io</a>
<br> 
<br>
The project consists of several parts, which make up the portfolio. In respositor you can find <b>HTML, CSS, SCSS, JS</b> files with two directories containing image files <b>jpg</b> and <b>png</b>.
The website was developed using <b>HTML5</b> and <b>SASS / LESS</b> preprocessor technology or super <b>css</b> technique, which is located on the <b>Ruby</b> platform.
<br>
<br>
It consists of three writings: <b>style.scss variable.scss grid_system.scss</b>. In the compilation process we get the <b>style_less.css</b> file, which is located on the <b>index.html</b> page. <b>head</b> tag contain source fonts for the fonts. Then <b>aos</b>, <b>jquery</b>, <b>animatescroll</b> codes for site integration. At the bottom of the page are four <b>JavaScript</b> files, which perform the functions I have rendered. And at the very end is <b>aos.init ()</b>, which causes you to perform the animation feature on the page.
 
In the portfolio section there are 6 products, which open links to three <b>html</b> pages and three <b>pdf</b> pages.

I did not use the <b>Boostrap</b> framework because I wanted to highlight my <b>SASS/LESS</b> capabilities and using <b>GRID</b> for a vised-dimensional layout.

The site is developed with semantic tags in <b>HTML</b>. For better <b>SEO</b> placement. It is also optimized on the <b>PNG</b>, <b>JPG</b> file size.

It is customizable for many device with <b>responsive</b> lines of code(<b>media queries</b> variables and <b>GRID</b> system). Because we are in the period of mobile-first displaying.

In short, about my portfolio.
