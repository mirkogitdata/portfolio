<h1>Portfolio description</h1>
<br>
You can see my portfolio <a href="https://mirkogitdata.github.io/portfolio/"  target="_blank">https://mirkogitdata.github.io/portfolio/</a>
<br>
<br>
The project consists of several parts, which make up the portfolio. In respositor you can find <b>HTML, CSS, SCSS, JS</b> files with two directories containing image files <b>jpg</b> and <b>png</b> and <b>gif</b>.
<br>
<br>
The website was developed using <b>HTML5</b> and <b>SASS / LESS</b> preprocessor technology or super css technique.
It consists of <b>style_new.scss</b> and <b>partials scss</b> files. In the compilation process we get the <b>style_new.css file</b>.
<br>
<br>
I was use <b>Visual Studio Code</b> with new features and support for <b>GIT</b> and <b>SCSS</b>. 
<br>
<br>
At the bottom of the page there are <b>JavaScript</b> files, which perform the functions I have rendered. And at the very end is aos.init (), which causes you to perform the animation feature on the page.
<br>
<br>
My new feature was added <b>preloader</b> in the top of <b>index.html </b>page with <b>gif</b> animation.
<br>
<br>
In the portfolio section there are 6 products, which open links to three html pages and three pdf pages.
<br>
<br>
I did not use the <b>Boostrap</b> framework because I wanted to highlight my <b>SASS/LESS</b> capabilities and using <b>flexbox</b> with <b>grid</b> for a vised-dimensional layout. The site is developed with semantic tags in <b>HTML</b> for better <b>SEO</b> placement. It is also optimized on the <b>PNG</b>, <b>JPG</b> file size.
It is customizable for many device with responsive lines of code(<b>media queries</b>) variables. Because we are in the first period of mobile displaying.
<br>
<br>
In short, about my portfolio.
