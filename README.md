The project consists of several parts, which make up the portfolio. In respositor you can find <b>HTML, CSS, SCSS, JS</b> files with two directories containing image files <b>jpg</b> and <b>png</b>.
The website was developed using <b>HTML5</b> and <b>SASS / LESS</b> preprocessor technology or super css technique, which is located on the Ruby platform.

It consists of three writings: <b>style.scss variable.scss grid_system.scss</b> In the compilation process we get the style.css file, which is located on the index.html page. he head tag contain source fonts for the font. Then aos, jquery, animatescroll codes for site integration.

At the bottom of the page are four <b>JavaScript</b> files, which perform the functions I have rendered. And at the very end is aos.init (), which causes you to perform the animation feature on the page.

In the portfolio section there are 6 products, which open links to three html pages and three pdf pages.

I did not use the <b>Boostrap</b> framework because I wanted to highlight my <b>SASS/LESS</b> capabilities and using <b>GRID</b> for a vised-dimensional layout.

The site is developed with semantic tags in <b>HTML</b> for better <b>SEO</b> placement. It is also optimized on the <b>PNG</b>, <b>JPG</b> file size.

It is customizable for many device with responsive lines of code(<b>media queries</b> variables and <b>GRID</b> system). Because we are in the first period of mobile displaying.

In short, about my portfolio.
